# Keytar Poller

Use your Rock Band 3 Keytar as a MIDI controller - wirelessly!
Connect a controller, start the program, select the controller index (0 to 3)
and the output MIDI device and start shredding.

I suggest installing [LoopBe1](https://www.nerds.de/en/download.html) if you want to use this as a midi controller for e.g. a DAW.

Use the left and right D-pad controlls to switch octaves.

No velocity support or touchpad support, yet.
